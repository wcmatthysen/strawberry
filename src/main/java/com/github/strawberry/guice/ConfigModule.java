/**
 * {@code RedisModule} is responsible for setting up the custom injections that
 * need to occur for the {@link Redis} field-annotations that may be present in
 * your classes. You simply need to install this {@link Module} inside your main
 * Guice {@code Module}, giving it the {@link JedisPool} of connections to your
 * Redis database as constructor argument. This is illustrated with the
 * following example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class MyCustomModule extends AbstractModule {
 *   
 *   private final JedisPool pool = new JedisPool("localhost", 6379);
 * 
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   protected void configure() {
 *     install(new RedisModule(this.pool));
 *     // set up the rest of your bindings.
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * However, this assumes that you don't want any caching to occur for the field
 * values that are loaded from the Redis database. For more fine-grained control
 * you can manually provide the {@link LoadingCache} of {@link Field}-to-value
 * mappings as the following example illustrates:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class MyCustomModule extends AbstractModule {
 *   
 *   private final JedisPool pool = new JedisPool("localhost", 6379);
 * 
 *   {@literal @}Override
 *   protected void configure() {
 *     LoadingCache<Field, Option> cache =
 *       CacheBuilder.newBuilder().
 *       expireAfterWrite(1, TimeUnit.DAYS).
 *       maximumSize(1000).
 *       build(new RedisLoader(this.pool));
 *     install(new RedisModule(cache));
 *     // set up the rest of your bindings.
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The abovementioned example will create a cache that stores up to 1000 field
 * values, and will expire these values after a day before loading them again
 * from the Redis database. See Google Guava's {@link CacheBuilder} class for
 * more comprehensive examples on how to construct a customized cache.
 * <b>Note</b>: the {@code CacheBuilder} requires a {@link CacheLoader} to
 * actually load the values into the cache if no matching key-value pair could
 * be found. The class responsible for this is {@link RedisLoader} and contains
 * the bulk of the logic that pertains to loading and transforming values from
 * Redis to be used as field-values.
